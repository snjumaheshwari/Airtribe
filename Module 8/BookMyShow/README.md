## Brief
Bookmyshow is a ticketing platform where you can book tickets for a movie show.

As part of this assignment, we need to build API’s for the following feature. As a user, I can select any theatre in the city. On selecting the theatre, I should be able to see the dates of next 7 days.

I can click on any date and the page should load to give me all the movies in that theatre on that given date. Movies should contain details of all the showtimes.The image represents the feature described on the previous page.

You have to code the APIs along with appropriate table structures for powering this UI.

Expected output of this assignment will be code submitted on github PR for all three questions. Parts that need subjective answers should be added to a doc and pushed to the top level git directory.

It’s been 2 years since you built this API. The API overtime has become slow. Which columns would you index to improve the performance of the API ? Why ?

You have noticed that even after indexing the columns the API speed isn’t under 100 ms. Update the code of existing API to cache the appropriate data in the redis. What all data would you cache and why ?

Create an API to book seats for you and you friend for a given theatre and a show.
